android-scripts
===============
This repo contains collection of useful Android scripts for everyday development. Scripts are inspired by my needs to automate some of the work when developing for Android.

As IDE I'm using Android Studio with Gradle as a build management system. It's important because some scripts are Android Studio or/and Gradle specific.


Scripts
==============
Most of the scripts are written in Bash or Python. Every script contains built-in help. Just invoke the script with `-h` switch.


Contribute
===============
If you want to add your script please send a pull request.

If you've found a bug please create an issue or even better send a pull request with fixes.
